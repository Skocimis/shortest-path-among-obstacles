# shortest-path-among-obstacles
<h1>Simulation of an algorithm finding a shortest path between polygonal obstacles</h1>

Controls: 
Drag points to move them
Click on an edge - create a new point in polygon
Drag mouse between two empty spaces - create a line, which you can later expand into polygon by clicking on it
Right click on free space - move to it following the shortest path
Press calculate path button - show the shortest path

Points in polygons have to go in clockwise order in order for algorithm to work.
