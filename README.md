<h1>Simulation of an algorithm finding a shortest path between polygonal obstacles</h1>

Controls: <br>
Drag points to move them<br>
Click on an edge - create a new point in polygon<br>
Drag mouse between two empty spaces - create a line, which you can later expand into polygon by clicking on it<br>
Right click on free space - move to it following the shortest path<br>
Press calculate path button - show the shortest path<br><br>

Vertices in polygons have to go in clockwise order in order for algorithm to work. <br>
